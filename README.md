# Hello!

I'm a pretty casual 2nd year CS and Math major in college. I maintain the ClearVision Organization with over 2 million known downloads, and software programmer with experience in CS in medical research. I encourage you to dm me at Nyx#9567 (now night.flower after the username changes) on discord with any of my stuff you may be using that I have broken, or join the ClearVision support server. I enjoy playing video games too (especially osu!) so let me know if you're a fan as well. 

I'm familiar with C I99, Java, Python/Pytorch, CSS, and JS (Svelte). I also have some experience with PostGRESQL, VHDL, and low level assembly code.

I have a website that's work in progress! You can find it at [hijiri.dev](https://www.hijiri.dev)

## Here are my github stats:
