# Hello!

I'm a pretty casual programmer in high school - this particular github account is for discord modifications and theming for the betterdiscord and Powercord injectors. I am a member of the ClearVision Team, solver of over 120 project Euler solutions, and hardware programmer with 3 device drivers under my belt (although admittedly extremely rough ones). I encourage you to dm me at Nyx#9567 on discord with any of my stuff you may be using that I have broken, or join the ClearVision support server. I enjoy playing video games too (especially osu!) so let me know if you're a fan as well. 

I have a website that's work in progress! You can find it at [hijiri.dev](https://www.hijiri.dev)

## Here are my github stats:
